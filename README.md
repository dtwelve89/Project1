2018 UCBX Coding Bootcamp Project 1

A collaborative project that was created to assist clients find events in any desired area.

With a simple user input, clients are able to navigate through events from an EventBrite API. A detailed map powered by MapQuest and LeafLet libraries is used to pinpoint event locations. Buying tickets and/or RSVP for an event is made easy straight from the application!
